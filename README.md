![](thumbnail.png)

## About the project

Bitcoin is a crypto-currency often criticized for its viability. Why ? The energy chasm it represents.
Mining bitcoin requires a great computing power, meaning a proportional amount of energy.

This visualization aims to give information about the energetic viability of Bitcoin : its origins, its evolution, comparision elements. It is therefore aimed at anyone interested in cryptocurrencies and the ecological impact.

This project was developed during a Data Visualization course and the details are available [on this page](https://lyondataviz.github.io/teaching/lyon1-m2/2019/projets.html).

Documents explaining the project evolution are available in the [Wiki section](https://github.com/pierrejonin/bitcoin_consumption/wiki).
